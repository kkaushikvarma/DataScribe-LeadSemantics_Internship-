Natural Language Generation from 2D Data
- Get insights on the trends and anomalies in data as a part of a narration.

## Instructions:
- 

## But how it learn?
##### Magic (just joking)
With deep learning.<br/>
Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning with neural networks inspired by the structure of the brains artificial neural networks.

### Playing with Artificial Intelligence:
1. Open your want game (If artificial intelligence tarined).
2. Run `python3 ai.py` command in terminal.

### Creating Train Dataset:
1. Run `python3 create_dataset.py` command in terminal.
2. Play your want game.
3. Stop `create_dataset` program with `Cntrl-C` in terminal.

### Model Training:
`python3 train.py`

### Using TensorBoard:
`tensorboard --logdir=Data/Checkpoints/logs`

### Important Notes:
- Used Python Version: 3.6.0

- Install necessary modules with `sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt` command.
